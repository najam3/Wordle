There are many algorithms that can be used to compare two arrays and find out if the values on the indexes are same. Here are some of them:

- **Brute force method**: This method compares each element of one array with every element of the other array. If it finds a match, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This method has a time complexity of O(n^2).

- **Sorting method**: This method sorts both arrays and then compares each element of one array with the corresponding element of the other array. If it finds a mismatch, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true. This method has a time complexity of O(n log n).

- **Hashing method**: This method uses a hash table to store the elements of one array and then checks if each element of the other array is present in the hash table. If it finds a match, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This method has a time complexity of O(n).

- **Subtraction method**: This method subtracts each element of one array from the corresponding element of the other array and then sums up all the differences. If the sum is zero, it means that both arrays have identical members; otherwise, they don't have identical members.
