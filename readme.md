This is Wordle clone I created, it relies on simple conditions, DOM manipulation, use of setTimeout() in very clever way to create animations. 
Everytime the game is restarted a new word is generated for the user to guess, player is given 5 tries in which he has to get the word right if fails the game simply 
display the correct word and you can start guessing again.
