There are many algorithms that can be used to compare two arrays and find out if the values on the indexes are same. Here are some of them:

*  The variable currentGuess represents how many guesses have been made. Each Array in the matrix is a word that is being guessed by the User. 

* The length of the positionTracker Array is limited to 5 which can act as the difficulty of the game because it limits  the word to be 5 in this particular demo. Once the length is reached till 5 the event is removed and the game is ended by pressing enter the algorithm checks for each letter in the matrix once the check is completed another array is being pushed representing another word.
