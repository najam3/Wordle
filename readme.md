## Game Implementation
This is Wordle clone I created, it relies on simple conditions, DOM manipulation, use of setTimeout() in very clever way to create animations. 
Everytime the game is restarted a new word is generated for the user to guess. 

# Rules

Player is given 5 tries in which he has to get the word right if fails the game simply display the correct word and you can start guessing again.
Other Rules are mentioned in the game itself.
